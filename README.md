# Hellfire Miles: React Edition
Summary goes here

## Note
This is not necessarily a replacement for the C# version, as I don't plan on deploying this version due to how basic it is. It's just an attempt at tackling a previous project idea of mine in a completely different context.

## Features
### Login
A ***very basic*** register & login system is implemented. It's pretty crappy, but it's my first, go easy on me.

Some things to note:
- You will get logged out every time you refresh the page (i.e. hit F5, Ctrl+R, etc.). Navigating pages normally shouldn't make this happen though.
- It's not a secure system - will need to look into implementing tokens and stuff at some point
- It just doesn't *look* all that good

## How to deploy (locally)
